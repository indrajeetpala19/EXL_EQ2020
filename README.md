XYZ is a media giant delivering services across Internet, Telephone and Television in Europe. They are current market leaders, with 2 out of every 5 Europeans as its customer in some form.


With a growing subscriber base, XYZ has noticed an increase in calls to Customer Representatives (Reps) queue, leading to a pile-up of pending tickets and a drop in customer experience (due to longer wait times and resolution times). With a long-term vision, XYZ decided to open a self-service portal instead of hiring more Reps, as this would have a two-fold direct impact – reduced cost due to fewer Reps, and improved customer experience due to a lower wait time. Also, this can be used for customized marketing, based on the platform a customer is likely to use. This self-service portal would be made available across 4 platforms – Desktop browser, Mobile browser, Mobile App & Set-top box, so as to reach customers on whatever platform they use/prefer.


Given this scenario, CEO of this company has hired EXL Service to determine target platform for every
customer who isn’t currently using the self-service portal.
